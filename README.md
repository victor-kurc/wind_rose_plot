# wind_rose_plot
How to create a plot for a given set of wind distributions. 

Usually avaiable data is formed with 12 wind bins, but for a more precise and accurate wind project, we expect a greater amount of bins.

This code below helps to transform 16 bins into a clear visualization of the new, improved wind farm.
